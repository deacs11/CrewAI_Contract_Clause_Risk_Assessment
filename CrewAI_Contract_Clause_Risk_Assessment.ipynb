            "1. **Clause 4.2: Automatic Renewal**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this MSA shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods, unless either Party provides written notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term.\"\n",
            "   - **Flagged Reason:** Automatic renewal without clear opt-out mechanisms increases the risk of inadvertently extending a contract that might no longer serve the interests of one or both parties.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Clause 7.2: Disclaimer of Other Warranties**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH IN SECTION 7.1, PROVIDER MAKES NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES OR DELIVERABLES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY; WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; WARRANTY OF TITLE; OR WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY; WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED BY LAW, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE OF TRADE, OR OTHERWISE.\"\n",
            "   - **Flagged Reason:** Broad disclaimer of implied warranties. This clause severely limits the provider's liability and protects them in cases where issues may arise from their services or deliverables.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Clause 8.1: Exclusion of Indirect Damages**\n",

            "   - **Flagged Reason:** Exclusion of indirect damages. This can severely limit recovery options in the event of significant non-direct damages.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Clause 8.2: Cap on Monetary Damages**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"IN NO EVENT SHALL PROVIDER'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PROVIDER PURSUANT TO THE APPLICABLE SOW(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.\"\n",
            "   - **Flagged Reason:** Cap on monetary damages. This limits the financial liability of the provider to the amount paid by the client, potentially ignoring the larger scale of losses experienced by the client.\n",

            "   - **Flagged Reason:** Terms \"generally recognized industry standards\" and \"adequate resources\" are vague and subjective, potentially leading to disputes over the adequacy of performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Clause 2.4: Change Orders**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"If either Party wishes to change the scope or execution of the Services under an SOW, it shall submit details of the requested change to the other Party in writing.\"\n",
            "   - **Flagged Reason:** Process for evaluating the impact of proposed changes is undefined, potentially leading to disagreements on adjustments to scope, fees, or timeline.\n",

            "4. **Clause 3.5: Late Payments**\n",

            "   - **Flagged Reason:** The term \"undisputed\" is not clearly defined, which might lead to confusion regarding what constitutes a disputed versus undisputed payment delay.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Clause 4.3: Termination for Cause**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"Either Party may terminate this MSA, or any individual SOW, effective upon written notice to the other Party, if the Defaulting Party: (a) materially breaches this MSA or the applicable SOW and such breach remains uncured thirty (30) days after the Defaulting Party receives written notice thereof.\"\n",

            "1. **Clause 4.2: Automatic Renewal**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"Upon expiration of the Initial Term, this MSA shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year periods, unless either Party provides written notice of non-renewal at least sixty (60) days prior to the end of the then-current term.\"\n",
            "   - **Flagged Reason:** Automatic renewal without clear opt-out mechanisms increases the risk of inadvertently extending a contract that might no longer serve the interests of one or both parties.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Clause 7.2: Disclaimer of Other Warranties**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"EXCEPT FOR THE EXPRESS WARRANTY SET FORTH IN SECTION 7.1, PROVIDER MAKES NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES OR DELIVERABLES, INCLUDING ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY; WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; WARRANTY OF TITLE; OR WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF A THIRD PARTY; WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED BY LAW, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE OF TRADE, OR OTHERWISE.\"\n",
            "   - **Flagged Reason:** Broad disclaimer of implied warranties. This clause severely limits the provider's liability and protects them in cases where issues may arise from their services or deliverables.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Clause 8.1: Exclusion of Indirect Damages**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"IN NO EVENT SHALL EITHER PARTY OR ITS AFFILIATES, OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, SUCCESSORS, OR ASSIGNS, BE LIABLE TO THE OTHER PARTY OR ANY THIRD PARTY FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WHETHER ARISING OUT OF BREACH OF CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE.\"\n",
            "   - **Flagged Reason:** Exclusion of indirect damages. This can severely limit recovery options in the event of significant non-direct damages.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Clause 8.2: Cap on Monetary Damages**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"IN NO EVENT SHALL PROVIDER'S AGGREGATE LIABILITY EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF FEES ACTUALLY PAID BY CLIENT TO PROVIDER PURSUANT TO THE APPLICABLE SOW(S) IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.\"\n",
            "   - **Flagged Reason:** Cap on monetary damages. This limits the financial liability of the provider to the amount paid by the client, potentially ignoring the larger scale of losses experienced by the client.\n",

            "\n",
            "1. **Clause 2.2: Performance of Services**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"Provider agrees to perform the Services described in each SOW using personnel of required skill, experience, and qualifications and in a professional and workmanlike manner in accordance with generally recognized industry standards for similar services.\"\n",
            "   - **Flagged Reason:** Terms \"generally recognized industry standards\" and \"adequate resources\" are vague and subjective, potentially leading to disputes over the adequacy of performance.\n",
            "\n",
            "2. **Clause 2.4: Change Orders**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"If either Party wishes to change the scope or execution of the Services under an SOW, it shall submit details of the requested change to the other Party in writing.\"\n",
            "   - **Flagged Reason:** Process for evaluating the impact of proposed changes is undefined, potentially leading to disagreements on adjustments to scope, fees, or timeline.\n",
            "\n",
            "3. **Clause 3.2: Expenses**\n",

            "   - **Flagged Reason:** The term \"reasonable\" is subjective and undefined, potentially leading to disputes over what constitutes a reasonable expense.\n",
            "\n",
            "4. **Clause 3.5: Late Payments**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"Undisputed amounts not paid when due shall accrue interest at a rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month from the date such payment was due until the date paid.\"\n",
            "   - **Flagged Reason:** The term \"undisputed\" is not clearly defined, which might lead to confusion regarding what constitutes a disputed versus undisputed payment delay.\n",
            "\n",
            "5. **Clause 4.3: Termination for Cause**\n",
            "   - **Text:** \"Either Party may terminate this MSA, or any individual SOW, effective upon written notice to the other Party, if the Defaulting Party: (a) materially breaches this MSA or the applicable SOW and such breach remains uncured thirty (30) days after the Defaulting Party receives written notice thereof.\"\n",
